        <p class="lead">B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia</p>
        
        <p>My academic journey began with a passion for solving complex medical and biological problems, which led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering (BME) at the University of Virginia. During my time at UVA, I had the opportunity to engage in rigorous coursework across engineering, biology, and healthcare systems, which laid the foundation for my analytical and problem-solving skills.</p>

        <p>Courses like <strong>Biomaterials</strong>, <strong>Medical Imaging</strong>, and <strong>Biomechanics</strong> gave me in-depth knowledge of the engineering principles behind medical devices and technologies. I was particularly drawn to the intersection of technology and healthcare, which inspired me to seek out research opportunities during my studies.</p>

        <p>However, my true shift in focus occurred during a transformative internship where I worked with cutting-edge <strong>graph databases</strong> and gained hands-on experience in analyzing complex, interconnected data related to <strong>insider threat detection</strong>. This internship opened my eyes to the power of data science and machine learning in solving real-world problemsâ€”especially in the context of security and risk management.</p>

        <p>This experience led to my pivot toward data science, where I began to develop a deep interest in <strong>data analytics</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>graph theory</strong>. My background in BME equipped me with a unique perspective on solving problems with data, and I am now pursuing further studies and certifications in <strong>Data Science</strong> to build on that foundation.</p>

        <p>By combining my technical background in engineering with data science, I aim to leverage advanced data-driven solutions to tackle challenges in both healthcare and real-world analytics, drawing from both fields to develop innovative solutions.</p>
